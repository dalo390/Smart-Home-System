# Home_IoT
This is a collaborative captsone project with peers Danny Do, Michael Hurt, Mallory Merkel, and Eugene Wu. We utilized ReactJS, Python, and JavaScript to allow users to track and manipulate home utility usage and data. We created three navigable screens to control home sensors, lights, 3 months of utility charts (water, electricity, 
costs), and utility predictions with JavaScript and React for front-end GUI. Python and SQL were utilized to generate and manipulate home data for the smart home system.    
  
Screen 1: aerial home layout view, buttons for turning home sensors on and off  
Screen 2: graph to display water, electricty, and costs for this month (option to choose previous months); predictive capabilites for the remainder of month  
Screen 3: tools for developer to simulate and generate home data
